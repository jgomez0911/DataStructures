Include some duplicate lines to test that the add method does not add duplicate items.
2-	Ask the user the name of the data file, read the file name, open the file, read the
file line by line, and upload the data to an <Item>SortedArraySet.
3-	Print the list. Make sure the items are in sorted order and there are no duplicates.
4-	Include at least two test cases for each one of the following methods: indexOf, remove, grab,
and categorySet. Make sure to print appropriate messages in the output so that it is easy to interpret your test cases.
